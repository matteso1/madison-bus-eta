  "description": "This dataset contains real-world bus arrival time predictions from Madison Metro Transit (Madison, WI) \ncollected over 20 days. It includes both the transit agency's API predictions and actual arrival times,\nmaking it ideal for time series forecasting, regression, and transportation ML applications.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- 200,000+ real-world predictions\n- 22 bus routes across Madison, Wisconsin  \n- 20 days of continuous data collection\n- API baseline predictions included (can you beat 0.371 min MAE?)\n- Temporal features (rush hour, weekday/weekend)\n- Route and stop characteristics\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- Arrival time prediction (regression)\n- Delay classification (binary classification)\n- Time series forecasting\n- Transportation analytics\n- ML model benchmarking against real API\n\n**Challenge:** Can you build a model that beats the Madison Metro API's predictions?\n(Our XGBoost model achieved 21.3% improvement!)",
