# 📋 Quick Reference Guide - Madison Metro ML

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
*"I built a machine learning system that predicts bus arrival times 21% more accurately than the official Madison Metro API. I collected 200,000+ real-world predictions over 20 days, engineered 28 features, and trained multiple ML models. My XGBoost model achieved 0.292 minutes MAE compared to the API's 0.371 minutes—a 21.3% improvement."*

## 💡 Top 3 Features to Highlight

1. **Beats Production System**: 21.3% improvement over real API
2. **Real-World Data**: 200k+ actual predictions, not a Kaggle dataset
3. **Full-Stack**: Complete pipeline from collection to deployment

## ❓ Quick Interview Q&A

**Q: What was the hardest part?**
A: Feature engineering for time-series data—using cyclical encodings (sin/cos) to capture temporal continuity.

**Q: Why XGBoost over neural networks?**
A: Better for tabular data, faster training, smaller model size, no GPU needed, and excellent performance.

**Q: How would you improve it?**
A: Add weather data, use LSTM for sequence modeling, expand to more cities, implement A/B testing in production.

**Q: How long did this take?**
A: 3-4 weeks total—1 week data collection, 1 week ML, 1-2 weeks web app.

🚌 Excited to share my Machine Learning project: Beating Public Transit APIs!

I built an ML system that predicts bus arrivals 21.3% more accurately than the 
official Madison Metro API.

📊 What I Did:
• Collected 204,380 real-world predictions over 20 days
• Engineered 28 features (temporal patterns, route stats, cyclical encodings)
• Trained 4 models—XGBoost achieved 0.292 min MAE vs API's 0.371 min
• Built full-stack app with Flask backend + React frontend

🎯 Key Results:
• 21.3% improvement over production baseline
• 100% of predictions within 2 minutes
• All 4 models beat the API

## 🎯 What Makes This Project Stand Out

1. ✅ **Real Impact** - Beats a production system
2. ✅ **Real Data** - 200k+ actual records, not synthetic
3. ✅ **Complete Pipeline** - Collection → Training → Deployment
4. ✅ **Quantifiable** - 21.3% is specific and measurable
5. ✅ **Production-Ready** - Live API, not just a notebook
6. ✅ **Full-Stack** - Backend + Frontend + ML
7. ✅ **Smart Approach** - Learns to correct API, not replace it
